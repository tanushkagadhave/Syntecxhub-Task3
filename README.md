🚀 Quick Start
1. Setup Environment

# Clone/create project folder
mkdir titanic-survival-prediction
cd titanic-survival-prediction

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Download Data

Download Titanic dataset from Kaggle:

    train.csv (891 passengers)
    test.csv (418 passengers)

Place files in data/ folder.
3. Run Notebooks

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Open notebooks/EDA.ipynb first
# Then notebooks/model_training.ipynb

📚 Notebook Breakdown
Notebook 1: EDA.ipynb (2-3 days)

Goals:

    Understand data structure and distributions
    Identify missing values and patterns
    Discover feature relationships with survival

Key Sections:

    Data Loading & Inspection - Shape, types, summary statistics
    Missing Value Analysis - Identify gaps in data
    Survival Distribution - 38% survived, 62% didn't
    Demographic Analysis:
        Sex: 74% females survived vs 19% males (strongest predictor)
        Class: 1st class 63% survival vs 3rd class 24%
        Age: Children more likely to survive
        Fare: Higher fares correlate with survival
    Family Relations - Solo travelers less likely to survive
    Embarked Port - Port of embarkation affects survival
    Correlation Heatmap - Feature relationships

Key Insights:

✓ Women and children prioritized (74% female survival)
✓ 1st class passengers had better access to lifeboats
✓ Younger passengers more likely to survive
✓ Higher fares = better survival (proxy for class)
✓ Solo travelers had lower survival rates

Visualizations: 12+ plots including heatmaps, distributions, box plots
Notebook 2: model_training.ipynb (4-7 days)

Goals:

    Prepare data for modeling
    Build and compare multiple models
    Evaluate performance with multiple metrics
    Generate predictions

Key Sections:
1. Feature Engineering (Most Important!)

✓ Age imputation by Pclass & Sex (more accurate than mean)
✓ Categorical encoding (Sex: 0/1, Embarked: 0/1/2)
✓ FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1
✓ IsAlone = (FamilySize == 1)
✓ FarePerPerson = Fare / FamilySize
✓ AgeGroup = Binned into 5 categories
✓ FareBin = Quartile binning
✓ Title extraction from Name (Mr, Mrs, Master, etc.)
✓ IsChild = (Age < 18)

2. Data Preparation

    Train/test split: 80/20 with stratification (preserves class ratio)
    Feature scaling for Logistic Regression (StandardScaler)
    No scaling needed for tree-based models

3. Model Comparison
Model 	Accuracy 	Precision 	Recall 	F1-Score 	ROC-AUC
Random Forest ✓ 	0.8371 	0.8205 	0.7500 	0.7843 	0.8949
Gradient Boosting 	0.8212 	0.8167 	0.6875 	0.7467 	0.8790
Logistic Regression 	0.8044 	0.7976 	0.6375 	0.7099 	0.8709

Winner: Random Forest 🏆
4. Evaluation Metrics

    Accuracy: Overall correctness (84%)
    Precision: Of predicted survivors, 82% actually survived
    Recall: Of actual survivors, 75% were correctly identified
    F1-Score: Harmonic mean balancing precision & recall
    ROC-AUC: 0.89 (excellent discrimination)

5. Feature Importance (Top Features)

    Sex (23%) - Most important
    Fare (18%)
    Age (15%)
    Pclass (12%)
    FamilySize (8%)
    Title (7%)

6. Visualizations Generated

    Confusion matrices (all 3 models)
    ROC curves (model comparison)
    Feature importance bar chart
    Model performance comparison
